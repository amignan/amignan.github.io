                  Mignan et al. (2019), Including seismic risk mitigation measures 
                    into the Levelized Cost Of Electricity in enhanced geothermal systems for optimal siting. 
                    Applied Energy, 238, 831-850, doi: 10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.109</a></h5>
                <p>The seismic risk associated with deep fluid injection in Enhanced Geothermal Systems can be 
                    mitigated by stopping reservoir stimulation when the seismic risk becomes unacceptable or by 
                    reducing production flow rates when seismicity occurs during the operational phase. So far, 
                    none of these mitigation measures have been included in the Levelized Cost Of Electricity. A 
                    meta-model is introduced that estimates the optimal price of electricity, based on an analytical 
                    geothermal energy model, and updates this cost to include the outlay for mandatory seismic risk 
                    mitigation measures. The proposed energy model computes both electricity production and heat 
                    credit. The costs added during reservoir stimulation are based on the probability of abandoning 
                    an injection well, based on a traffic-light system, defined as the ratio of scenarios that 
                    exceed a given seismic safety threshold in the risk space. In the production phase, the net 
                    energy generated is reduced by clipping the production flow rate so that the reservoir's 
                    overpressure does not exceed the regional minimum effective stress. Based on a generic 
                    geothermal triplet, we investigate the trade-off between heat credit and seismic risk mitigation 
                    cost. The added cost, mostly due to financial risk aversion, shifts the optimal site for a 
                    plant from between a few kilometres to tens of kilometres away from populated areas, for 
                    increasingly vulnerable building stocks. Finally, using a simple yet realistic optimisation 
                    strategy, we study the role that a seismic safety standard plays for determining the number of 
                    EGS plants that can be sited in a given region.</p>

              <p>The historical record of earthquakes is a crucial data resource for seismic hazard analysis. 
                  In every region, the largest events are rare and difficult to parameterize. In cases for which 
                  such events are associated with the ruptures of mapped faults, defining the extent of possible 
                  fault ruptures is an important challenge that is often guided by historical precedent in which 
                  geologic, particularly paleoseismic, studies are limited. Counterfactual risk analysis recognizes 
                  that a historical event is just one realization of many possible alternatives: a fault rupture 
                  that happened in the past is just one of numerous ways in which seismic energy might have been 
                  dynamically released. Stochastic modeling of past earthquakes can provide additional insight 
                  into the complex geometry of multifault rupture. This counterfactual approach that is advocated 
                  here extends the effective time window of observation of the fault rupture process, well beyond 
                  the time span of earthquake catalogs. The basic concepts of counterfactual risk analysis are 
                  explained, followed by a seismological discussion of runaway earthquakes, illustrated in the case 
                  of the North Anatolian fault (NAF) in Turkey. This notable example demonstrates the practical 
                  utility of the counterfactual approach as a new supplementary tool for addressing one of the 
                  most difficult problems in probabilistic seismic hazard and risk assessment: selecting the 
                  multifault combinations to model as explicit seismic sources.</p>

                    light system for actuarial decision-making during deep fluid injections. Scientific Reports, 
                    7, 13607, doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-13585-9</a></h5>
                <p>The rise in the frequency of anthropogenic earthquakes due to deep fluid injections is posing 
                    serious economic, societal, and legal challenges to many geo-energy and waste-disposal projects. 
                    Existing tools to assess such problems are still inherently heuristic and mostly based on expert 
                    elicitation (so-called clinical judgment). We propose, as a complementary approach, an adaptive 
                    traffic light system (ATLS) that is function of a statistical model of induced seismicity. It offers 
                    an actuarial judgement of the risk, which is based on a mapping between earthquake magnitude and 
                    risk. Using data from six underground reservoir stimulation experiments, mostly from Enhanced 
                    Geothermal Systems, we illustrate how such a data-driven adaptive forecasting system could 
                    guarantee a risk-based safety target. The proposed model, which includes a linear relationship 
                    between seismicity rate and flow rate, as well as a normal diffusion process for post-injection, 
                    is first confirmed to be representative of the data. Being integrable, the model yields a 
                    closed-form ATLS solution that is both transparent and robust. Although simulations verify that 
                    the safety target is consistently ensured when the ATLS is applied, the model from which simulations 
                    are generated is validated on a limited dataset, hence still requiring further tests in additional 
                    fluid injection environments.</p>
