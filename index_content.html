    <h3>A portfolio <small class="text-muted">of catastrophe risk research projects and applications</small></h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am a catastrophe risk researcher, with both academic and insurance industry background. 
      My interests include:</p>
    <p>
      &bull; <i>Extreme event modelling</i>: Physics of tail-events and domino effects;<br>
      &bull; <i>Earthquake forecasting</i>: Physics and statistics of seismicity laws,
      pattern recognition;<br>
      &bull; <i>Algorithmic risk governance</i>: Decision making under uncertainty, optimization, behavioural science;<br>
      &bull; <i>Energy security/public safety trade-off</i>: Deep geo-energy / carbon storage 
      induced seismicity;<br>
      &bull; <i>Meta-science</i>: Scientific trends, status-quo biases, new theoretical horizons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promote cross-disciplinary research and reasoned imagination, using 
      data analytics, machine learning, and first principles. I follow the motto "<a href="https://medium.com/the-history-risk-forecast-of-perils" target="_blank">History, Risk & Forecast</a>" to learn
      from past catastrophes & past research, to evaluate existing risks, and finally to mitigate the risk via event forecasting.
      This website is a work in progress, with interactive catastrophe risk tools planned to be added over time.
