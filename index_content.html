    <p>The seismic risk associated with deep fluid injection in Enhanced Geothermal Systems can be 
      mitigated by stopping reservoir stimulation when the seismic risk becomes unacceptable or by 
      reducing production flow rates when seismicity occurs during the operational phase. So far, 
      none of these mitigation measures have been included in the Levelized Cost Of Electricity. 
      A meta-model is introduced that estimates the optimal price of electricity, based on an 
      analytical geothermal energy model, and updates this cost to include the outlay for mandatory 
      seismic risk mitigation measures... <a target=_blank

    <p>The historical record of earthquakes is a crucial data resource for seismic hazard analysis. 
      In every region, the largest events are rare and difficult to parameterize. In cases for which 
      such events are associated with the ruptures of mapped faults, defining the extent of possible 
      fault ruptures is an important challenge that is often guided by historical precedent in which 
      geologic, particularly paleoseismic, studies are limited. Counterfactual risk analysis 
      recognizes that a historical event is just one realization of many possible alternatives: a 
      fault rupture that happened in the past is just one of numerous ways in which seismic energy 
      might have been dynamically released. Stochastic modeling of past earthquakes can provide 
      additional insight into the complex geometry of multifault rupture. This counterfactual 
      approach that is advocated here extends the effective time window of observation of the fault 
      rupture process, well beyond the time span of earthquake catalogs... <a target=_blank

      <p>The rise in the frequency of anthropogenic earthquakes due to deep fluid injections is 
        posing serious economic, societal, and legal challenges to many geo-energy and 
        waste-disposal projects. Existing tools to assess such problems are still inherently 
        heuristic and mostly based on expert elicitation (so-called clinical judgment). We propose, 
        as a complementary approach, an adaptive traffic light system (ATLS) that is function of 
        a statistical model of induced seismicity. It offers an actuarial judgement of the risk, 
        which is based on a mapping between earthquake magnitude and risk. Using data from six 
        underground reservoir stimulation experiments, mostly from Enhanced Geothermal Systems, 
        we illustrate how such a data-driven adaptive forecasting system could guarantee a 
        risk-based safety target.... <a target=_blank
