      <p><b><span>rseismNet</span></b>: Investigating the properties of the earthquake frequency-magnitude 
        distribution (FMD) is the first necessary step of any seismicity analysis. The R package rseismNet 
        provides a suite of statistical functions to determine the completeness magnitude mc and the seismicity 
        properties below and above this threshold. “Net” refers to network, (1) for the seismic network 
        properties described by the FMD shape below mc, and (2) for the earthquake fault network properties 
        described by the Gutenberg-Richter law above mc. rseismNet also implements the Bayesian Magnitude of 
        Completeness (BMC) method (Mignan et al., 2011, doi: 10.1785/0120100223), which maps mc based on a 
        seismic network prior.</p>

          on the rseismNet functions.</p>

        <p><b><span>rseismTLS</span></b>: The rise in the frequency of anthropogenic earthquakes due to deep 
          fluid injections is posing serious economic, societal, and legal challenges to many geo-energy and 
          waste-disposal projects. The rseismTLS package provides actuarial tools to analyse, forecast and 
          mitigate induced seismicity during underground stimulation, based on a TLS (i.e. Traffic Light 
          System) procedure. It reflects the need to quantify the dynamic nature of the industrial operations 
          and underground feedback, and complements the standard TLS approach that is inherently heuristic and 
          mostly based on expert elicitation (so-called clinical judgment). [<i>only forecasting part available at 
          the present time</i>]</p>

          <p><b>COMING SOON</b> R&D project 'Critical-infrastructure (EGS) earthquake forecasting statistical learning' with interactive plots and 
            tools based on the rseismTLS functions.</p>
